# Weather-App




## Weather App

This is a weather application built with React.js that utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to display real-time weather data. The app provides information such as temperature, location, current date and time, weather conditions, humidity, pressure, wind speed, and cloudiness.

### Prerequisites

Before running the weather app, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (version 10 or above)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the weather app up and running:

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project's root directory.

3. Install the project dependencies by running the following command:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Sign up for an API key at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) if you don't have one already. The API key is required to fetch weather data.

5. Create a `.env` file in the project's root directory and add the following line, replacing `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key:

   ```
   REACT_APP_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
   ```

6. Save the `.env` file.

7. Run the development server using the following command:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

8. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the weather app in action.
